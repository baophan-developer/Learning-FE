# **Function expressions** ([link resource](https://javascript.info/function-expressions))

There is another syntax for creating a function that is called a _Function Expression_.

```javascript
let sayHi = function () {
	alert("Hello");
};
```

## **Function is a value**

Let’s reiterate: no matter how the function is created, a function is a value.

We can even print out that value using <code>alert</code>

```javascript
function sayHi() {
	alert("Hello");
}

alert(sayHi); // shows the function code
```

Please note that the last line does not run the function, because there are no parentheses after <code>sayHi</code>. There are programming languages where any mention of a function name causes its execution, but JavaScript is not like that.

In JavaScript, a function is a value, so we can deal with it as a value.

We can copy a function to another variable:

```javascript
function sayHi() {
	// (1) create
	alert("Hello");
}

let func = sayHi; // (2) copy

func(); // Hello     // (3) run the copy (it works)!
sayHi(); // Hello    //     this still works too (why wouldn't it)
```

Here’s what happens above in detail:

1. The Function Declaration <code>(1)</code> creates the function and puts it into the variable named <code>sayHi</code>.
2. Line <code>(2)</code> copies it into the variable <code>func</code>. Please note again: there are no parentheses after <code>sayHi</code>. If there were, then <code>func = sayHi()</code> would write _the result of the call_ <code>sayHi()</code> into <code>func</code>, not _the function_ <code>sayHi</code> _itself_.
3. Now the function can be called as both <code>sayHi()</code> and <code>func()</code>.

## **Callback functions**

Let’s look at more examples of passing functions as values and using function expressions.

We’ll write a function <code>ask(question, yes, no)</code> with three parameters:

<code>question</code> - text of the question.

<code>yes</code> - function to run if the answer is "yes".

<code>no</code> - function to run if the answer is "no".

```javascript
function ask(question, yes, no) {
	if (confirm(question)) yes();
	else no();
}

function showOk() {
	alert("You agreed.");
}

function showCancel() {
	alert("You canceled the execution.");
}

// usage: functions showOk, showCancel are passed as arguments to ask
ask("Do you agree?", showOk, showCancel);
```

<strong>The arguments <code>showOk</code> and <code>showCancel</code> of ask are called _callback functions_ or just _callbacks_.</strong>

We can use Function Expressions to write an equivalent, shorter function:

```javascript
function ask(question, yes, no) {
	if (confirm(question)) yes();
	else no();
}

ask(
	"Do you agree?",
	function () {
		alert("You agreed.");
	},
	function () {
		alert("You canceled the execution.");
	},
);
```

Here, functions are declared right inside the <code>ask(...)</code> call. They have no name, and so are called _anonymous_. Such functions are not accessible outside of <code>ask</code> (because they are not assigned to variables), but that’s just what we want here.

## **Function Expression vs Function Declaration**

How to differentiate between them in the code.

-   _Function Declaration_: a function, declared as a separate statement, in the main code flow:

```javascript
// Function Declaration
function sum(a, b) {
	return a + b;
}
```

-   _Function Expression_: a function, created inside an expression or inside another syntax construct. Here, the function is created on the right side of the “assignment expression” <code>=</code>:

```javascript
// Function Expression
let sum = function (a, b) {
	return a + b;
};
```

<strong>
	A Function Expression is created when the execution reaches it and is usable only from that moment.
</strong>

<strong>Function Declarations are different. A Function Declaration can be called earlier than it is defined.</strong>

That’s due to internal algorithms. When JavaScript prepares to run the script, it first looks for global Function Declarations in it and creates the functions. We can think of it as an “initialization stage”.

And after all Function Declarations are processed, the code is executed. So it has access to these functions.

```javascript
sayHi("John"); // Hello, John

function sayHi(name) {
	alert(`Hello, ${name}`);
}
```

If it were a Function Expression, then it wouldn’t work:

```javascript
sayHi("John"); // error!

let sayHi = function (name) {
	// (*) no magic any more
	alert(`Hello, ${name}`);
};
```

Function Expressions are created when the execution reaches them. That would happen only in the line <code>(\*)</code>. Too late.

<strong>In strict mode, when a Function Declaration is within a code block, it’s visible everywhere inside that block. But not outside of it.</strong>

```javascript
let age = prompt("What is your age?", 18);

// conditionally declare a function
if (age < 18) {
	function welcome() {
		alert("Hello!");
	}
} else {
	function welcome() {
		alert("Greetings!");
	}
}

// ...use it later
welcome(); // Error: welcome is not defined
```

The correct approach would be to use a Function Expression and assign <code>welcome</code> to the variable that is declared outside of <code>if</code> and has the proper visibility.

```javascript
let age = prompt("What is your age?", 18);

let welcome;

if (age < 18) {
	welcome = function () {
		alert("Hello!");
	};
} else {
	welcome = function () {
		alert("Greetings!");
	};
}

welcome(); // ok now
```
