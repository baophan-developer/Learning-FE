# **Arrow functions, the basics** ([link resource](https://javascript.info/arrow-functions-basics))

There’s another very simple and concise syntax for creating functions, that’s often better than Function Expressions.

It’s called “arrow functions”, because it looks like this:

```javascript
let func = (arg1, arg2, ..., argN) => expression;
```

Arrow functions can be used in the same way as Function Expressions.

```javascript
let age = prompt("What is your age?", 18);

let welcome = age < 18 ? () => alert("Hello!") : () => alert("Greetings!");

welcome();
```

## **Multiline arrow functions**

Sometimes we need a more complex function, with multiple expressions and statements. In that case, we can enclose them in curly braces. The major difference is that curly braces require a <code>return</code> within them to return a value (just like a regular function does).

```javascript
let sum = (a, b) => {
	// the curly brace opens a multiline function
	let result = a + b;
	return result; // if we use curly braces, then we need an explicit "return"
};

alert(sum(1, 2)); // 3
```
