# **The modern mode, "use strict"**

## **"use strict"**

The directive looks like a string: <code>"use strict"</code> or <code>'use strict'</code>. When is it located at the top of a script the whole script works the "modern" way.

```javascript
"use strict";

// this code works the modern way
```

> [!WARNING] **Ensure that "use strict" is at the top**
> Please make sure that <code>"use strict"</code> is at the top of your scripts, otherwise strict mode may not be enabled.

> [!WARNING] **There's no way to cancel "use strict"**

## **Browser console**

Please note, Browser console doesn't <code>"use strict"</code> by default

You can try to press <code>Shift + Enter</code> to input multiple lines, and put <code>"use strict"</code> on top.

## **Should we "use strict"**

Modern Javascript supports "classes" and "modules" - advanced language structures (we'll surely get to them), that enable <code>use strict</code> automatically. So we don't need to add the <code>"use strict"</code> directive, if we use them.

**So, for now <code>"use strict";</code> is a welcome guest at the top of your scripts. Later, when your code is all in classes and modules, you may omit it.**
