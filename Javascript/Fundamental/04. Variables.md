# **Variables** ([link resources](https://javascript.info/variables))

## **A variable**

A variable is a "named storage" for data.

To create a variable in Javascript, use the <code>let</code> keyword.

```javascript
let message;
let user = "John",
	age = 25,
	message = "Hello";
```

## **A real-life analogy**

The variable <code>message</code> can be imagined as a box labelled <code>"message"</code> with the value <code>"Hello!"</code> in it:

<img src="https://javascript.info/article/variables/variable.svg" alt="" width="166" height="145">

We can put any value in the box.

We can also change it as many times as we want:

```javascript
let message;

message = "Hello!";

message = "World!"; // Value changed

alert(message);
```

When the value is changed, the old data is return is removed from the variable:

We can also declare two variables and copy data from one into the other.

```javascript
let hello = "Hello world!";

let message;

// copy "Hello world" from hello to message
message = hello;

// now two variables hold the same data
alert(hello);
alert(message);
```

## **Variable naming**

There are two limitations on variable names in Javascript:

-   The name must contain only letters, digit, or the symbols <code>$</code> and <code>\_</code>.
-   The first character must not be a digit.

When the name contains multiple words, <span style="color: #436ebd">camelCase</span> is commonly used.

> [!NOTE]
> **Case matters** <br>
> Variables named <code>apple</code> or <code>APPLE</code> are two different variables.

> [!NOTE]
> **Non-Latin letters are allowed, but not recommended** <br>

> [!WARNING]
> **An assignment without <code>use strict</code>**
> In the old times, it was technically possible to create a variable by a mere assignment of the value without using <code>let</code>
>
> ```javascript
> // note: no "use strict" in this example
>
> num = 5; // the variable "num" is created if it didn't exist
>
> alert(num);
> ```
>
> This is a bad practice and would cause an error in strict mode:
>
> ```javascript
> "use strict";
> num = 5; // error: num is not defined
> ```

## **Constants**

To declare a constants (unchanging) variable, use <code>constant</code> instead of <code>let</code>.

Variables declared using <code>const</code> are called "constants". They cannot be reassigned.
