# **Code Structure** ([link resource](https://javascript.info/structure))

## **Statements**

Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions.

```javascript
alert("Hello");
alert("World");
```

## **Semicolons**

A semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a lines break exists.

**In most cases, a newline implies a semicolon. But "in most cases" does not mean "always"!.**

**But there are situations where JavaScript "fails" to assume a semicolon where it is really needed.**

## **Comment**

As times go on, programs become more and more complex. It becomes necessary to add _comments_ which describe what the code does and why.

Comments can be put into any place of a script. They don't affect its execution because the engine simply ignores them.

**One-line comments start with to slash character <code>//</code>**

```javascript
// This comment occupies a line of its own
alert("Hello");

alert("World"); // This comment follows the statement
```

**Multiline comments start with a forward slash and asterisk <code>/\*</code> and end with an asterisk and a forward slash.**

```javascript
/* An example with to messages.
This is a multiline comment.
 */
alter("Hello");
alter("World");
```

Sometimes it can be handy to temporarily disable a part of code.

```javascript
/* Commenting out the code
alter("Hello");
 */
alter("World");
```
