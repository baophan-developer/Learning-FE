# **Conditional branching: if, "?"**

## **The "if" statement**

The <code>if(...)</code> statement evaluates a condition in parentheses and, if the result is true, executes a block of code.

```javascript
let year = prompt("In which year was ECMAScript-2015 specification published?", "");

if (year == 2015) alert("You are right!");
```

If we want to execute more than one statement, we have to wrap our code block inside curly braces:

```javascript
if (year == 2015) {
	alert("That's correct!");
	alert("You're so smart!");
}
```

## **Boolean conversion**

The <code>if (…)</code> statement evaluates the expression in its parentheses and converts the result to a boolean.

-   A number <code>0</code>, an empty string <code>""</code>, <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code>, and <code>NaN</code> all become <code>false</code>. Because of that they are called “falsy” values.
-   Other values become true, so they are called “truthy”.

We can also pass a pre-evaluated boolean value to if, like this:

```javascript
let cond = (year == 2015); // equality evaluates to true or false

if (cond) {
  ...
}
```

## **The "else" clause**

The <code>if</code> statement may contain an optional <code>else</code> block. It executes when the condition is falsy.

```javascript
let year = prompt("In which year was the ECMAScript-2015 specification published?", "");

if (year == 2015) {
	alert("You guessed it right!");
} else {
	alert("How can you be so wrong?"); // any value except 2015
}
```

## **Several conditions: "else if"**

Sometimes, we’d like to test several variants of a condition. The <code>else if</code> clause lets us do that.

```javascript
let year = prompt("In which year was the ECMAScript-2015 specification published?", "");

if (year < 2015) {
	alert("Too early...");
} else if (year > 2015) {
	alert("Too late");
} else {
	alert("Exactly!");
}
```

There can be more <code>else if</code> blocks. The final <code>else</code> is optional.

## **Conditional operator "?"**

The operator is represented by a question mark <code>?</code>. Sometimes it’s called “ternary”, because the operator has three operands. It is actually the one and only operator in JavaScript which has that many.

```javascript
let result = condition ? value1 : value2;
```

## **Multiple "?"**

A sequence of question mark operators <code>?</code> can return a value that depends on more than one condition.

```javascript
let age = prompt("age?", 18);

let message =
	age < 3
		? "Hi, baby!"
		: age < 18
		? "Hello!"
		: age < 100
		? "Greetings!"
		: "What an unusual age!";

alert(message);
```

## **Non-traditional use of "?"**

Sometimes the question mark <code>?</code> is used as a replacement for <code>if</code>

```javascript
let company = prompt("Which company created JavaScript?", "");

company == "Netscape" ? alert("Right!") : alert("Wrong.");
```
