# **Basic operators, maths** ([link resource](https://javascript.info/operators))

## **Terms: "unary", "binary", "operand"**

-   _An operand_ - is what operators are applied to. For instance, in the multiplication of <code>5 \* 2</code> there are two operands: the left operand is <code>5</code> and the right operand is <code>2</code>. Sometimes, people call these “arguments” instead of “operands”.

-   An operator is _unary_ if it has a single operand. For example, the unary negation - reverses the sign of a number

```javascript
let x = 1;

x = -x;
alert(x); // -1, unary negation was applied
```

-   An operator is _binary_ if it has two operands. The same minus exists in binary form as well

```javascript
let x = 1,
	y = 3;
alert(y - x); // 2, binary minus subtracts values
```

## **Maths**

The following math operations are supported:

-   Addition +,
-   Subtraction -,
-   Multiplication \*,
-   Division /,
-   Remainder %,
-   Exponentiation \*\*.

## **Reminder %**

The result of <code>a % b</code> is the remainder of the integer division of <code>a</code> by <code>b</code>.

```javascript
alert(5 % 2); // 1, the remainder of 5 divided by 2
alert(8 % 3); // 2, the remainder of 8 divided by 3
alert(8 % 4); // 0, the remainder of 8 divided by 4
```

## **Exponentiation**

The exponentiation operator <code>a \*\* b</code> raises a to the power of <code>b</code>.

```javascript
alert(2 ** 2); // 2² = 4
alert(2 ** 3); // 2³ = 8
alert(2 ** 4); // 2⁴ = 16
```

Just like in maths, the exponentiation operator is defined for non-integer numbers as well.

```javascript
alert(4 ** (1 / 2)); // 2 (power of 1/2 is the same as a square root)
alert(8 ** (1 / 3)); // 2 (power of 1/3 is the same as a cubic root)
```

## **String concatenation with binary +**

if the binary <code>+</code> is applied to strings, it merges (concatenates) them

```javascript
let s = "my" + "String";
alert(s); // myString
```

Note that if any of the operands is a string, then the other one is converted to a string too.

```javascript
alert("1" + 2); // "12"
alert(2 + "1"); // "21"
alert(2 + 2 + "1"); // "41" and not "221"
alert("1" + 2 + 2); // "122" and not "14"
```

The binary <code>+</code> is the only operator that supports strings in such a way. Other arithmetic operators work only with numbers and always convert their operands to numbers.

```javascript
alert(6 - "2"); // 4, converts '2' to a number
alert("6" / "2"); // 3, converts both operands to numbers
```

## **Numeric conversion, unary +**

The plus <code>+</code> exists in two forms: the binary form that we used above and the unary form.

The plus operator + applied to a single value, doesn’t do anything to numbers. But if the operand is not a number, the unary plus converts it into a number.

```javascript
// No effect on numbers
let x = 1;
alert(+x); // 1

let y = -2;
alert(+y); // -2

// Converts non-numbers
alert(+true); // 1
alert(+""); // 0
```

It actually does the same thing as Number(...), but is shorter.

## **Operator precedence**

| **Precedence** | **Name**       | **Sign** |
| :------------: | :------------- | :------: |
|       14       | unary plus     |    +     |
|       14       | unary negation |    -     |
|       13       | exponentiation |   \*\*   |
|       12       | multiplication |    \*    |
|       12       | multiplication |    \     |
|       11       | addition       |    +     |
|       11       | subtraction    |    -     |
|       2        | assignment     |    =     |

## **Assignment**

Let’s note that an assignment <code>=</code> is also an operator.

That’s why, when we assign a variable, like <code>x = 2 \* 2 + 1</code>, the calculations are done first and then the = is evaluated, storing the result in <code>x</code>.

```javascript
let x = 2 * 2 + 1;
alert(x); // 5
```

### **Assignment = returns a value**

All operators in JavaScript return a value. That’s obvious for <code>+</code> and <code>-</code>, but also true for <code>=</code>.

The call <code>x = value</code> writes the <code>value</code> into <code>x</code> and then _returns it._

```javascript
let a = 1;
let b = 2;

let c = 3 - (a = b + 1);

alert(a); // 3
alert(c); // 0
```

<span style="background-color:yellow;padding:5px"><strong>Please don’t write the code like that</strong></span>

### **Chaining assignments**

Another interesting feature is the ability to chain assignments:

```javascript
let a, b, c;
a = b = c = 2 + 2;

alert(a); // 4
alert(b); // 4
alert(c); // 4
```

Once again, for the purposes of readability it’s better to split such code into few lines:

```javascript
c = 2 + 2;
b = c;
a = c;
```

## **Modify-in-place**

We often need to apply an operator to a variable and store the new result in that same variable.

```javascript
let n = 2;
n = n + 5;
n = n * 2;
```

This notation can be shortened using the operators <code>+=</code> and <code>\*=</code>:

```javascript
let n = 2;
n += 5; // now n = 7 (same as n = n + 5)
n *= 2; // now n = 14 (same as n = n * 2)

alert(n); // 14
```

Short “modify-and-assign” operators exist for all arithmetical and bitwise operators: <code>/=</code>, <code>-=</code>, etc.

## **Increment/decrement**

**Increment** <code>++</code> increases a variable by 1

```javascript
let counter = 2;
counter++; // works the same as counter = counter + 1, but is shorter
alert(counter); // 3
```

**Decrement** <code>--</code> decreases a variable by 1

```javascript
let counter = 2;
counter--; // works the same as counter = counter - 1, but is shorter
alert(counter); // 1
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Increment/decrement can only be applied to variables. Trying to use it on a value like 5++ will give an error.

The operators <code>++</code> and <code>--</code> can be placed either before or after a variable.

-   When the operator goes after the variable, it is in “postfix form”: <code>counter++</code>.
-   The “prefix form” is when the operator goes before the variable: <code>++counter</code>.

Both of these statements do the same thing: increase <code>counter</code> by <code>1</code>.

The prefix form returns the new value while the postfix form returns the old value (prior to increment/decrement).

To see the difference, here’s an example:

```javascript
let counter = 1;
let a = ++counter; // (*)

alert(a); // 2
```

In the line <code>(\*)</code>, the prefix form <code>++counter</code> increments <code>counter</code> and returns the new value, <code>2</code>. So, the <code>alert</code> shows <code>2</code>.

Now, let’s use the postfix form:

```javascript
let counter = 1;
let a = counter++; // (*) changed ++counter to counter++

alert(a); // 1
```

In the line <code>(\*)</code>, the postfix form <code>counter++</code> also increments <code>counter</code> but returns the old value (prior to increment). So, the <code>alert</code> shows <code>1</code>.
