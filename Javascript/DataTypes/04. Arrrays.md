# **Arrays** ((link resource)[https://javascript.info/array])

## **Declaration**

There are two syntaxes for creating an empty array:

```javascript
let arr = new Array();
let arr = [];
```

Almost all the time, the second syntax is used. We can supply initial elements in the brackets:

```javascript
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Plum"];
```

Array elements are numbered, starting with zero.

We can get an element by its number in square brackets:

```javascript
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Plum"];

alert(fruits[0]); // Apple
alert(fruits[1]); // Orange
alert(fruits[2]); // Plum
```

We can replace an element:

```javascript
fruits[2] = "Pear"; // now ["Apple", "Orange", "Pear"]
```

…Or add a new one to the array:

```javascript
fruits[3] = "Lemon"; // now ["Apple", "Orange", "Pear", "Lemon"]
```

The total count of the elements in the array is its <code>length</code>:

```javascript
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Plum"];

alert(fruits); // Apple,Orange,Plum
```

An array can store elements of any type.

For instance:

```javascript
// mix of values
let arr = [
	"Apple",
	{name: "John"},
	true,
	function () {
		alert("hello");
	},
];

// get the object at index 1 and then show its name
alert(arr[1].name); // John

// get the function at index 3 and run it
arr[3](); // hello
```

## **Get last elements with "at"**

```javascript
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Plum"];

// same as fruits[fruits.length-1]
alert(fruits.at(-1)); // Plum
```

<code>arr.at(i):</code>

-   is exactly the same as <code>arr[i]</code>, if <code>i >= 0</code>.
-   for negative values of <code>i</code>, it steps back from the end of the array.

## **Methods pop/push, shift/unshift**

-   <code>push</code> appends an element to the end.
-   <code>shift</code> get an element from the beginning, advancing the queue, so that the 2nd element becomes the 1st.

There’s another use case for arrays – the data structure named stack.

It supports two operations:

-   <code>push</code> adds an element to the end.
-   <code>pop</code> takes an element from the end.

For stacks, the latest pushed item is received first, that’s also called LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle. For queues, we have FIFO (First-In-First-Out).

Arrays in JavaScript can work both as a queue and as a stack. They allow you to add/remove elements, both to/from the beginning or the end.

### **Methods that work with the end of the array:**

<code>pop</code>

Extracts the last element of the array and returns it:

```javascript
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Pear"];

alert(fruits.pop()); // remove "Pear" and alert it

alert(fruits); // Apple, Orange
```

Both <code>fruits.pop()</code> and <code>fruits.at(-1)</code> return the last element of the array, but <code>fruits.pop()</code> also modifies the array by removing it.

<code>push</code>

Append the element to the end of the array:

```javascript
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange"];

fruits.push("Pear");

alert(fruits); // Apple, Orange, Pear
```

The call <code>fruits.push(...)</code> is equal to <code>fruits[fruits.length]</code> = ....

### **Methods that work with the beginning of the array:**

<code>shift</code>

Extracts the first element of the array and returns it:

```javascript
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Pear"];

alert(fruits.shift()); // remove Apple and alert it

alert(fruits); // Orange, Pear
```

<code>unshift</code>

Add the element to the beginning of the array:

```javascript
let fruits = ["Orange", "Pear"];

fruits.unshift("Apple");

alert(fruits); // Apple, Orange, Pear
```

Methods <code>push</code> and <code>unshift</code> can add multiple elements at once:

```javascript
let fruits = ["Apple"];

fruits.push("Orange", "Peach");
fruits.unshift("Pineapple", "Lemon");

// ["Pineapple", "Lemon", "Apple", "Orange", "Peach"]
alert(fruits);
```

## **Internals**

An array is a special kind of object. The square brackets used to access a property <code>arr[0]</code> actually come from the object syntax. That’s essentially the same as <code>obj[key]</code>, where <code>arr</code> is the object, while numbers are used as keys.

They extend objects providing special methods to work with ordered collections of data and also the <code>length</code> property. But at the core it’s still an object.

## **Performance**

Methods <code>push/pop</code> run fast, while <code>shift/unshift</code> are slow.

The <code>shift</code> operation must do 3 things:

1.  Remove the element with the index <code>0</code>.
2.  Move all elements to the left, renumber them from the index <code>1</code> to <code>0</code>, from <code>2</code> to <code>1</code> and so on.
3.  Update the <code>length</code> property.

<code>The more elements in the array, the more time to move them, more in-memory operations.</code>

<strong>The <code>pop</code> method does not need to move anything, because other elements keep their indexes. That’s why it’s blazingly fast.</strong>

## **Loops**

One of the oldest ways to cycle array items is the <code>for</code> loop over indexes:

```javascript
let arr = ["Apple", "Orange", "Pear"];

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
	alert(arr[i]);
}
```

But for arrays there is another form of loop, <code>for..of</code>:

```javascript
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Plum"];

// iterates over array elements
for (let fruit of fruits) {
	alert(fruit);
}
```

Technically, because arrays are objects, it is also possible to use <code>for..in</code>:

```javascript
let arr = ["Apple", "Orange", "Pear"];

for (let key in arr) {
	alert(arr[key]); // Apple, Orange, Pear
}
```

## **A word about "length"**

The <code>length</code> property automatically updates when we modify the array. To be precise, it is actually not the count of values in the array, but the greatest numeric index plus one.

For instance, a single element with a large index gives a big length:

```javascript
let fruits = [];
fruits[123] = "Apple";

alert(fruits.length); // 124
```

## **new Array()**

There is one more syntax to create an array:

```javascript
let arr = new Array("Apple", "Pear", "etc");
```

If <code>new Array</code> is called with a single argument which is a number, then it creates an array _without items, but with the given length_.

Let’s see how one can shoot themselves in the foot:

```javascript
let arr = new Array(2); // will it create an array of [2] ?

alert(arr[0]); // undefined! no elements.

alert(arr.length); // length 2
```

## **Multidimensional arrays**

Arrays can have items that are also arrays. We can use it for multidimensional arrays, for example to store matrices:

```javascript
let matrix = [
	[1, 2, 3],
	[4, 5, 6],
	[7, 8, 9],
];

alert(matrix[0][1]); // 2, the second value of the first inner array
```

## **toString**

Arrays have their own implementation of <code>toString</code> method that returns a comma-separated list of elements.

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3];

alert(arr); // 1,2,3
alert(String(arr) === "1,2,3"); // true
```

## **Don’t compare arrays with ==**
