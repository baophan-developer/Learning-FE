# **Iterables** ((link resource)[https://javascript.info/iterable])

## **Symbol.iterator**

```javascript
let range = {
	from: 1,
	to: 5,
};

// We want the for..of to work:
// for(let num of range) ... num=1,2,3,4,5
```

To make the <code>range</code> object iterable (and thus let <code>for..of</code> work) we need to add a method to the object named <code>Symbol.iterator</code> (a special built-in symbol just for that).

1. When <code>for..of</code> starts, it calls that method once (or errors if not found). The method must return an _iterator_ – an object with the method <code>next</code>.
2. Onward, <code>for..of</code> works _only with that returned object_.
3. When <code>for..of</code> wants the next value, it calls <code>next()</code> on that object.
4. The result of <code>next()</code> must have the form <code>{done: Boolean, value: any}</code>, where <code>done=true</code> means that the loop is finished, otherwise <code>value</code> is the next value.

```javascript
let range = {
	from: 1,
	to: 5,
};

// 1. call to for..of initially calls this
range[Symbol.iterator] = function () {
	// ...it returns the iterator object:
	// 2. Onward, for..of works only with the iterator object below, asking it for next values
	return {
		current: this.from,
		last: this.to,

		// 3. next() is called on each iteration by the for..of loop
		next() {
			// 4. it should return the value as an object {done:.., value :...}
			if (this.current <= this.last) {
				return {done: false, value: this.current++};
			} else {
				return {done: true};
			}
		},
	};
};

// now it works!
for (let num of range) {
	alert(num); // 1, then 2, 3, 4, 5
}
```

## **String is iterable**

Arrays and strings are most widely used built-in iterables.

```javascript
for (let char of "test") {
	// triggers 4 times: once for each character
	alert(char); // t, then e, then s, then t
}
```

## **Calling an iterator explicitly**

```javascript
let str = "Hello";

// does the same as
// for (let char of str) alert(char);

let iterator = str[Symbol.iterator]();

while (true) {
	let result = iterator.next();
	if (result.done) break;
	alert(result.value); // outputs characters one by one
}
```

## **Iterables and array-likes**

Two official terms look similar, but are very different. Please make sure you understand them well to avoid the confusion.

-   _Iterables_ are objects that implement the <code>Symbol.iterator</code> method, as described above.
-   _Array-likes_ are objects that have indexes and <code>length</code>, so they look like arrays.

## **Array.from**

```javascript
let arrayLike = {
	0: "Hello",
	1: "World",
	length: 2,
};

let arr = Array.from(arrayLike); // (*)
alert(arr.pop()); // World (method works)
```

<code>Array.from</code> at the line <code>(\*)</code> takes the object, examines it for being an iterable or array-like, then makes a new array and copies all items to it.

The full syntax for <code>Array.from</code> also allows us to provide an optional “mapping” function:

```javascript
Array.from(obj[, mapFn, thisArg])
```

The optional second argument <code>mapFn</code> can be a function that will be applied to each element before adding it to the array, and <code>thisArg</code> allows us to set this for it.

```javascript
// assuming that range is taken from the example above

// square each number
let arr = Array.from(range, (num) => num * num);

alert(arr); // 1,4,9,16,25
```
