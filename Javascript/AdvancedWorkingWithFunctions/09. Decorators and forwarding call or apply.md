# **Decorators and forwarding, call/apply** ((link resource)[https://javascript.info/call-apply-decorators])

## **Transparent caching**

Let's say we have a function <code>slow(x)</code> which is CPU-heavy, but its results are stable. In other words, for the same <code>x</code> it always returns the same result.

If the function is called often, we may want to cache (remember) the result to avoid spending extra-time on recalculations.

But instead of adding that functionality into show() we'll create a wrapper function, that adds caching. As we'll see, there are many benefits of doing so.

```javascript
function slow(x) {
	// there can be a heavy CPU-intensive job here
	alert(`Called with ${x}`);
	return x;
}

function cachingDecorator(func) {
	let cache = new Map();

	return function (x) {
		if (cache.has(x)) {
			// if there's such key in cache
			return cache.get(x); // read the result from it
		}

		let result = func(x); // otherwise call func

		cache.set(x, result); // and cache (remember) the result
		return result;
	};
}

slow = cachingDecorator(slow);

alert(slow(1)); // slow(1) is cached and the result returned
alert("Again: " + slow(1)); // slow(1) result returned from cache

alert(slow(2)); // slow(2) is cached and the result returned
alert("Again: " + slow(2)); // slow(2) result returned from cache
```

## **Using "func.call" for the context**

The caching decorator mentioned above is not suited to work with object methods.

```javascript
// we'll make worker.slow caching
let worker = {
	someMethod() {
		return 1;
	},

	slow(x) {
		// scary CPU-heavy task here
		alert("Called with " + x);
		return x * this.someMethod(); // (*)
	},
};

// same code as before
function cachingDecorator(func) {
	let cache = new Map();
	return function (x) {
		if (cache.has(x)) {
			return cache.get(x);
		}
		let result = func(x); // (**)
		cache.set(x, result);
		return result;
	};
}

alert(worker.slow(1)); // the original method works

worker.slow = cachingDecorator(worker.slow); // now make it caching

alert(worker.slow(2)); // Whoops! Error: Cannot read property 'someMethod' of undefined
```

The error occurs in the line <code>(\*)</code> that tries to access <code>this.someMethod</code> and fails. Can you see why?

The reason is that wrapped calls the original functions as <code>func(x)</code> in the line <code>(\*\*)</code>. And, when called like that, the function gets <code>this = undefined</code>.

We would observe a similar symptom if we tried to run:

```javascript
let func = worker.slow;
func(2);
```

So, the wrapper passes the call to the original method, but without the context <code>this</code>. Hence the error.

Let's fix it.

There's a special built-in function method <code>func.call(context,...args)</code> that allows to call a function explicitly setting <code>this</code>.

```javascript
func.call(context, arg1, arg2, ...)
```

To put it simply, these two calls do almost the same:

```javascript
func(1, 2, 3);
func.call(obj, 1, 2, 3);
```

They both call <code>func</code> with arguments <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>. The only difference is that <code>func.call</code> also sets <code>this</code> to <code>obj</code>.

```javascript
let worker = {
	someMethod() {
		return 1;
	},

	slow(x) {
		alert("Called with " + x);
		return x * this.someMethod(); // (*)
	},
};

function cachingDecorator(func) {
	let cache = new Map();
	return function (x) {
		if (cache.has(x)) {
			return cache.get(x);
		}
		let result = func.call(this, x); // "this" is passed correctly now
		cache.set(x, result);
		return result;
	};
}

worker.slow = cachingDecorator(worker.slow); // now make it caching

alert(worker.slow(2)); // works
alert(worker.slow(2)); // works, doesn't call the original (cached)
```

Now everything is fine:

To make it all clear, let's see more deeply how <code>this</code> is passed along:

1. After the decoration <code>worker.slow</code> is now the wrapper <code>function (x) {...}</code>.

2. So when <code>worker.slow(2)</code> is executed, the wrapper gets <code>2</code> as an argument and <code>this=worker</code>.

3. Inside the wrapper, assuming the result is not yet cached, <code>func.call(this, x)</code> passes the current <code>this</code>(<code>=worker</code>) and then current argument (<code>=2</code>) to the original method.

## **Going multi-argument**

Now let's make <code>cachingDecorator</code> even more universal. Till now it was working only with single-argument functions.

Now how to cache the multi-argument <code>worker.slow</code> method?

```javascript
let worker = {
	slow(min, max) {
		return min + max; // scary CPU-hogger is assumed
	},
};

// should remember same-argument calls
worker.slow = cachingDecorator(worker.slow);
```

Previously, for a single argument <code>x</code> we could just <code>cache.set(x, result)</code> to save the result and <code>cache.get(x)</code> to retrieve it. But now we need to remember the result for a combination of arguments <code>(min, max)</code>. The native <code>Map</code> takes single value only as the key.

There are many solutions possible:

1. Implement a new (or use a third-party) map-like data structure that is more versatile and allows multi-keys.
2. Use nested maps: <code>cache.set(min)</code> will be a <code>Map</code> that stores the pair <code>(max, result)</code>. So we can get <code>result</code> as <code>cache.get(min).get(max)</code>.
3. Join two values into one. In our particular case we can just use a string <code>"min, max"</code> as the <code>Map</code> key. For flexibility, we can allow to provide a hashing function for the decorator, that knows how to make one value from many.

Here's a more powerful <code>cachingDecorator</code>:

```javascript
let worker = {
	slow(min, max) {
		alert(`Called with ${min},${max}`);
		return min + max;
	},
};

function cachingDecorator(func, hash) {
	let cache = new Map();
	return function () {
		let key = hash(arguments); // (*)
		if (cache.has(key)) {
			return cache.get(key);
		}

		let result = func.call(this, ...arguments); // (**)

		cache.set(key, result);
		return result;
	};
}

function hash(args) {
	return args[0] + "," + args[1];
}

worker.slow = cachingDecorator(worker.slow, hash);

alert(worker.slow(3, 5)); // works
alert("Again " + worker.slow(3, 5)); // same (cached)
```

Now it works any number of arguments (though the hash function would also need to be adjusted to allow any number of arguments. An interesting way to handle this will be covered below).

There are two changes:

-   In the line <code>(\*)</code> it calls <code>hash</code> to create a single key from <code>arguments</code>. Here we use a simple "joining" function that turns arguments <code>(3, 5)</code> into the key <code>"3,5"</code>. More complex cases may require other hashing functions.
-   Then <code>\*\*</code> uses <code>func.call(this, ...arguments)</code> to pass both the context and all arguments the wrapper got (not just the first one) to the original function.

## **func.apply**

Instead of <code>func.call(this, ...arguments)</code> we could use <code>func.apply(this, arguments)</code>.

The syntax of built-in method func.apply is:

```javascript
func.apply(context, args);
```

It run the <code>func</code> setting <code>this=context</code> and using an array-like object args as the list of arguments.

There two calls are almost equivalent:

```javascript
func.call(context, ...args);
func.apply(context, args);
```

They perform the same call of <code>func</code> with given context and arguments.

There's only a subtle difference regarding <code>args</code>:

-   The spread syntax <code>...</code> allows to pass iterable <code>args</code> as the list to <code>call</code>.
-   The <code>apply</code> accepts only array-like <code>args</code>.

...And for objects that are both iterable and array-like, such as a real array, we can use any of them, but <code>apply</code> will probably be faster, because most JavaScript engines internally optimize it better.

Passing all arguments along with the context to another function is called _call forwarding_.

That's the simplest form of it:

```javascript
let wrapper = function () {
	return func.apply(this, arguments);
};
```

When an external code calls such <code>wrapper</code>, it is indistinguishable from the call of the original function <code>func</code>.

## Borrowing a method

Now let's make one more minor improvement in the hashing function:

```javascript
function hash(args) {
	return args[0] + "," + args[1];
}
```

As of now, it works only on two arguments. It would be better if it could glue any number of <code>arg</code>

The natural solution would be to use arr.json method:

```javascript
function hash(args) {
	return args.join();
}
```

...Unfortunately, that won't work. Because we are calling <code>hash(arguments)</code>, and <code>arguments</code> object is both iterable and array-like, but not a real array.

So calling <code>join</code> on it would fail, as we can see below.

```javascript
function hash() {
	alert(arguments.join()); // Error: arguments.join is not a function
}

hash(1, 2);
```

Still, there's an easy way to use array join:

```javascript
function hash() {
	alert([].join.call(arguments)); // 1,2
}

hash(1, 2);
```

The trick is called _method borrowing_.

We take (borrow) a join method from a regular array (<code>[].join</code>) and use <code>[].join.call</code> to run it in the context of <code>arguments</code>.

Why does it work?

That's because the internal algorithm of the native method <code>arr.join(glue)</code> is very simple.

Take from the specification almost "as-is":

1. Let <code>glue</code> be the first argument or, if no arguments, them a comma <code>","</code>.

2. Let <code>result</code> be an empty string.

3. Append <code>this[0]</code> to <code>result</code>.

4. Append <code>glue</code> and <code>this[1]</code>.

5. Append <code>glue</code> and <code>this[2]</code>.

6. ...Do so until <code>this.length</code> items are glued.

7. Return <code>result</code>.

## Decorators and function properties

It is generally safe to replace a function or a method with a decorated one, except for one little thing. If the original function had properties on it, like <code>func.calledCount</code> or whatever, then the decorated one will not provide them. Because that is a wrapper. So one needs to be careful if one uses them.

E.g. in the example above if <code>slow</code> function had any properties on it, then <code>cachingDecorator(slow)</code> is a wrapper without them.

Some decorators may provide their own properties. E.g. a decorator may count how many times a function was invoked and how much time it took, and expose this information via wrapper properties.

There exists a way to create decorators that keep access to function properties, but this requires using a special <code>Proxy</code> object to wrap a function. We'll discuss it later in the article Proxy and Reflect.
