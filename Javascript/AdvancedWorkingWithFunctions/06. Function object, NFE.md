# **Function object, NFE** ((link resource)[https://javascript.info/function-object])

As we already know, a function in JavaScript is a value.

Every value in JavaScript has a type. In Javascript, functions are objects.

A good way to imagine functions is as callable "action objects".

## **The "name" property**

Function objects contain some usable properties.

```javascript
function sayHi() {
	alert("Hi");
}

alert(sayHi.name); // sayHi
```

## **The "length" property**

There is another built-in property "length" that returns the number of function parameters, for instance:

```javascript
function f1(a) {}
function f2(a, b) {}
function many(a, b, ...more) {}

alert(f1.length); // 1
alert(f2.length); // 2
alert(many.length); // 2
```

## **Custom properties**

We can also add properties of our own.

```javascript
function sayHi() {
	alert("Hi");

	// let's count how many times we run
	sayHi.counter++;
}
sayHi.counter = 0; // initial value

sayHi(); // Hi
sayHi(); // Hi

alert(`Called ${sayHi.counter} times`); // Called 2 times
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> **A property is not a variable**
>
> A property assigned to a function like <code>sayHi.counter = 0</code> does not define a local variable <code>counter</code> inside it. In other words, a property <code>counter</code> and a variable <code>let counter</code> are two unrelated things.

## **Named Function Expression**

Named Function Expression, or NFE, is a term for Function Expressions that have a name.

```javascript
let sayHi = function func(who) {
	alert(`Hello, ${who}`);
};
```

First let's note, that we still have a Function Expression. Adding the name <code>"func"</code> after <code>function</code>
did not make it a Function Declaration, because it is still created as a part of an assignment expression.

Adding such a name also did not break anything.

The function is still available as <code>sayHi()</code>:

```javascript
let sayHi = function func(who) {
	alert(`Hello, ${who}`);
};

sayHi("John"); // Hello, John
```

There are two special things about the name <code>func</code>, that are the reasons for it:

1. It allows the function to reference itself internally.
2. It is not visible outside of the function.

```javascript
let sayHi = function func(who) {
	if (who) {
		alert(`Hello, ${who}`);
	} else {
		func("Guest"); // use func to re-call itself
	}
};

sayHi(); // Hello, Guest

// But this won't work:
func(); // Error, func is not defined (not visible outside of the function)
```

Why do we use <code>func</code>? Maybe just use <code>sayHi</code> for the nested call?

Actually, in most cases we can:

```javascript
let sayHi = function (who) {
	if (who) {
		alert(`Hello, ${who}`);
	} else {
		sayHi("Guest");
	}
};
```

The problem with that code is that <code>sayHi</code> may change in the outer code. If the function gets assigned to another variable instead, the code will start to give errors.

```javascript
let sayHi = function (who) {
	if (who) {
		alert(`Hello, ${who}`);
	} else {
		sayHi("Guest"); // Error: sayHi is not a function
	}
};

let welcome = sayHi;
sayHi = null;

welcome(); // Error, the nested sayHi call doesn't work any more!
```

That happens because the function takes <code>sayHi</code> from its outer lexical environment. There's no local <code>sayHi</code>, so the outer variable is used. And at the moment of the call that outer <code>sayHi</code> is <code>null</code>.
