# **Global object** ((link resources)[https://javascript.info/global-object])

The global object provides variables and functions that are available anywhere. By default, those that are built-into the language or the environment.

In browser it is named <code>window</code>, for Node.js it is <code>global</code>, for other environments it may have another name.

Recently, <code>globalThis</code> was added to the language, as a standardized name for a global object, that should be supported across all environments. It's supported in all major browsers.

We'll use <code>window</code> here, assuming that our environment is a browser. If your script may run in other environments, it's better to use <code>globalThis</code> instead.

All properties of the global object can be accessed directly:

```javascript
alert("Hello");
// is the same as
window.alert("Hello");
```

In a browser, global functions and variables declared with <code>var</code> (not <code>let/const</code>) become the property of the global object:

```javascript
var gVar = 5;

alert(window.gVar); // 5 (became a property of the global object)
```

## **Using for polyfills**

We use the global object to test for support of modern language features.

```javascript
if (!window.Promise) {
	alert("Your browser is really old!");
}

if (!window.Promise) {
  window.Promise = ... // custom implementation of the modern language feature
}
```
