# **Constructor, operator "new"** ([link resource](https://javascript.info/constructor-new))

## **Constructor function**

Constructor functions technically are regular functions. There are two conventions though:

1. They are named with capital letter first.
2. They should be executed only with <code>"new"</code> operator.

```javascript
function User(name) {
	this.name = name;
	this.isAdmin = false;
}

let user = new User("Jack");

alert(user.name); // Jack
alert(user.isAdmin); // false
```

When a function is executed with new, it does the following steps:

1. A new empty object is created and assigned to this.
2. The function body executes. Usually it modifies this, adds new properties to it.
3. The value of this is returned.

In other words, <code>new User(...)</code> does something like:

```javascript
function User(name) {
	// this = {};  (implicitly)

	// add properties to this
	this.name = name;
	this.isAdmin = false;

	// return this;  (implicitly)
}
```

> 	// local variables etc
> })();

> This constructor can’t be called again, because it is not saved anywhere, just created and called. So this trick aims to encapsulate the code that constructs the single object, without future reuse.

## **Constructor mode test: new.target**

Inside a function, we can check whether it was called with new or without it, using a special <code>new.target</code> property.

It is undefined for regular calls and equals the function if called with <code>new</code>.

```javascript
function User() {
	alert(new.target);
}

// without "new":
User(); // undefined

// with "new":
new User(); // function User { ... }
```

```javascript
function User(name) {
	if (!new.target) {
		// if you run me without new
		return new User(name); // ...I will add new for you
	}

	this.name = name;
}

let john = User("John"); // redirects call to new User
alert(john.name); // John
```

## **Return from constructors**

Usually, constructors do not have a <code>return</code> statement. Their task is to write all necessary stuff into <code>this</code>, and it automatically becomes the result.

But if there is a <code>return</code> statement, then the rule is simple:

-   If <code>return</code> is called with an object, then the object is returned instead of <code>this</code>.
-   If <code>return</code> is called with a primitive, it’s ignored.

In other words, <code>return</code> with an object returns that object, in all other cases <code>this</code> is returned.

```javascript
function BigUser() {
	this.name = "John";

	return {name: "Godzilla"}; // <-- returns this object
}

alert(new BigUser().name); // Godzilla, got that object
```

```javascript
function SmallUser() {
	this.name = "John";

	return; // <-- returns this
}

alert(new SmallUser().name); // John
```

## **Methods in constructor**

```javascript
function User(name) {
	this.name = name;

	this.sayHi = function () {
		alert("My name is: " + this.name);
	};
}

let john = new User("John");

john.sayHi(); // My name is: John

/*
john = {
   name: "John",
   sayHi: function() { ... }
}
*/
```
