# **Object** ([link resource](https://javascript.info/object))

As we know from the chapter Data types, there are eight data types in JavaScript. Seven of them are called “primitive”, because their values contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever).

In contrast, objects are used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities.

An object can be created with figure brackets <code>{…}</code> with an optional list of _properties_. A property is a “key: value” pair, where <code>key</code> is a string (also called a “property name”), and <code>value</code> can be anything.

An empty object can be created using one of two syntaxes:

```javascript
let user = new Object(); // "object constructor" syntax
let user = {}; // "object literal" syntax
```

Usually, the figure brackets <code>{...}</code> are used. That declaration is called an _object literal_.

## **Literals and properties**

We can immediately put some properties into <code>{...}</code> as “key: value” pairs:

```javascript
// an object
let user = {
	name: "John", // by key "name" store value "John"
	age: 30, // by key "age" store value 30
};
```

Property values are accessible using the dot notation:

```javascript
// get property values of the object:
alert(user.name); // John
alert(user.age); // 30
```

The value can be of any type. Let’s add a boolean one:

```javascript
user.isAdmin = true;
```

To remove a property, we can use the delete operator:

```javascript
delete user.age;
```

We can also use multi-word property names, but then they must be quoted:

```javascript
let user = {
	name: "John",
	age: 30,
	"likes birds": true, // multi-word property name must be quoted
};
```

The last property in the list may end with a comma:

```javascript
let user = {
	name: "John",
	age: 30,
};
```

That is called a “trailing” or “hanging” comma. Makes it easier to add/remove/move around properties, because all lines become alike

## **Square brackets**

The dot requires the key to be a valid variable identifier. That implies: contains no spaces, doesn’t start with a digit and doesn’t include special characters (<code>$</code> and <code>\_</code> are allowed).

There’s an alternative “square bracket notation” that works with any string:

```javascript
let user = {};

// set
user["likes birds"] = true;

// get
alert(user["likes birds"]); // true

// delete
delete user["likes birds"];
```

Square brackets also provide a way to obtain the property name as the result of any expression – as opposed to a literal string – like from a variable as follows:

```javascript
let key = "likes birds";

// same as user["likes birds"] = true;
user[key] = true;
```

## **Computed properties**

We can use square brackets in an object literal, when creating an object. That’s called _computed properties_.

```javascript
let fruit = prompt("Which fruit to buy?", "apple");

let bag = {
	[fruit]: 5, // the name of the property is taken from the variable fruit
};

alert(bag.apple); // 5 if fruit="apple"
```

That works the same as:

```javascript
let fruit = prompt("Which fruit to buy?", "apple");
let bag = {};

// take property name from the fruit variable
bag[fruit] = 5;
```

### **Property value shorthand**

In real code, we often use existing variables as values for property names.

```javascript
function makeUser(name, age) {
	return {
		name: name,
		age: age,
		// ...other properties
	};
}

let user = makeUser("John", 30);
alert(user.name); // John
```

Instead of <code>name:name</code> we can just write <code>name</code>, like this:

```javascript
function makeUser(name, age) {
	return {
		name, // same as name: name
		age, // same as age: age
		// ...
	};
}
```

## **Property names limitations**

As we already know, a variable cannot have a name equal to one of the language-reserved words like “for”, “let”, “return” etc.

But for an object property, there’s no such restriction:

```javascript
// these properties are all right
let obj = {
	for: 1,
	let: 2,
	return: 3,
};

alert(obj.for + obj.let + obj.return); // 6
```

Other types are automatically converted to strings.

```javascript
let obj = {
	0: "test", // same as "0": "test"
};

// both alerts access the same property (the number 0 is converted to string "0")
alert(obj["0"]); // test
alert(obj[0]); // test (same property)
```

## **Property existence test, "in" operator**

A notable feature of objects in JavaScript, compared to many other languages, is that it’s possible to access any property. There will be no error if the property doesn’t exist!

```javascript
let user = {};

alert(user.noSuchProperty === undefined); // true means "no such property"
```

There’s also a special operator "in" for that.

The syntax is:

```javascript
"key" in object;
```

```javascript
let user = {name: "John", age: 30};

alert("age" in user); // true, user.age exists
alert("address" in user); // false, user.address doesn't exist
```

Please note that on the left side of in there must be a property name. That’s usually a quoted string.

If we omit quotes, that means a variable should contain the actual name to be tested.

```javascript
let user = {age: 30};

let key = "age";
alert(key in user); // true, property "age" exists
```

Well, most of the time the comparison with <code>undefined</code> works fine. But there’s a special case when it fails, but <code>"in"</code> works correctly.

It’s when an object property exists, but stores <code>undefined</code>:

```javascript
let obj = {
	test: undefined,
};

alert(obj.test); // it's undefined, so - no such property?

alert("test" in obj); // true, the property does exist!
```

In the code above, the property <code>obj.test</code> technically exists. So the <code>in</code> operator works right.

## **The "for...in" loop**

To walk over all keys of an object, there exists a special form of the loop: <code>for..in</code>. This is a completely different thing from the <code>for(;;)</code> construct that we studied before.

The syntax:

```javascript
for (key in object) {
	// executes the body for each key among object properties
}
```

```javascript
let user = {
	name: "John",
	age: 30,
	isAdmin: true,
};

for (let key in user) {
	// keys
	alert(key); // name, age, isAdmin
	// values for the keys
	alert(user[key]); // John, 30, true
}
```

## **Ordered like an object**

```javascript
let codes = {
	49: "Germany",
	41: "Switzerland",
	44: "Great Britain",
	// ..,
	1: "USA",
};

for (let code in codes) {
	alert(code); // 1, 41, 44, 49
}
```

So, to fix the issue with the phone codes, we can “cheat” by making the codes non-integer. Adding a plus "+" sign before each code is enough.

```javascript
let codes = {
	"+49": "Germany",
	"+41": "Switzerland",
	"+44": "Great Britain",
	// ..,
	"+1": "USA",
};

for (let code in codes) {
	alert(+code); // 49, 41, 44, 1
}
```
