# **Garbage collection** ([link resource](https://javascript.info/garbage-collection))

Memory management in JavaScript is performed automatically and invisibly to us. We create primitives, objects, functions… All that takes memory.

What happens when something is not needed any more? How does the JavaScript engine discover it and clean it up?

## **Reachability**

The main concept of memory management in JavaScript is _reachability_.

Simply put, “reachable” values are those that are accessible or usable somehow. They are guaranteed to be stored in memory.

1. There’s a base set of inherently reachable values, that cannot be deleted for obvious reasons.

    For instance:

    - The currently executing function, its local variables and parameters.
    - Other functions on the current chain of nested calls, their local variables and parameters.
    - Global variables.
    - (there are some other, internal ones as well)

    These values are called _roots_.

2. Any other value is considered reachable if it’s reachable from a root by a reference or by a chain of references.

## **A simple example**

```javascript
// user has a reference to the object
let user = {
	name: "John",
};
```

If the value of <code>user</code> is overwritten, the reference is lost.

```javascript
user = null;
```

Now John becomes unreachable. There’s no way to access it, no references to it. Garbage collector will junk the data and free the memory.

## **Two references**

Now let’s imagine we copied the reference from user to admin:

```javascript
// user has a reference to the object
let user = {
	name: "John",
};

let admin = user;
```

Now if we do the same:

```javascript
user = null;
```

…Then the object is still reachable via <code>admin</code> global variable, so it must stay in memory. If we overwrite <code>admin</code> too, then it can be removed.

## **Interlinked objects**

Now a more complex example. The family:

```javascript
function marry(man, woman) {
	woman.husband = man;
	man.wife = woman;

	return {
		father: man,
		mother: woman,
	};
}

let family = marry(
	{
		name: "John",
	},
	{
		name: "Ann",
	},
);
```

The result memory structure:

As of now, all objects are reachable.

Now let’s remove two references:

```javascript
delete family.father;
delete family.mother.husband;
```

<img src="https://javascript.info/article/garbage-collection/family-delete-refs.svg
" alt="" width="337" height="204">

It’s not enough to delete only one of these two references, because all objects would still be reachable.

But if we delete both, then we can see that John has no incoming reference any more:

<img src="https://javascript.info/article/garbage-collection/family-no-father.svg
" alt="" width="337" height="204">

Outgoing references do not matter. Only incoming ones can make an object reachable. So, John is now unreachable and will be removed from the memory with all its data that also became unaccessible.

After garbage collection:

## **Unreachable island**

It is possible that the whole island of interlinked objects becomes unreachable and is removed from the memory.

The source object is the same as above. Then:

```javascript
family = null;
```

The in-memory picture becomes:

<img src="https://javascript.info/article/garbage-collection/family-no-family.svg
" alt="" width="337" height="204">

This example demonstrates how important the concept of reachability is.

It’s obvious that John and Ann are still linked, both have incoming references. But that’s not enough.

The former <code>"family"</code> object has been unlinked from the root, there’s no reference to it any more, so the whole island becomes unreachable and will be removed.

## **Internal Algorithms**

The basic garbage collection algorithm is called “mark-and-sweep”.

The following “garbage collection” steps are regularly performed:

-   The garbage collector takes roots and “marks” (remembers) them.
-   Then it visits and “marks” all references from them.
-   Then it visits marked objects and marks their references. All visited objects are remembered, so as not to visit the same object twice in the future.
-   …And so on until every reachable (from the roots) references are visited.
-   All objects except marked ones are removed.

For instance, let our object structure look like this:

<img src="https://javascript.info/article/garbage-collection/garbage-collection-1.svg
" alt="" width="463" height="204">

We can clearly see an “unreachable island” to the right side. Now let’s see how “mark-and-sweep” garbage collector deals with it.

The first step marks the roots:

" alt="" width="463" height="204">

Then we follow their references and mark referenced objects:

<img src="https://javascript.info/article/garbage-collection/garbage-collection-3.svg
" alt="" width="463" height="204">

…And continue to follow further references, while possible:

<img src="https://javascript.info/article/garbage-collection/garbage-collection-4.svg
" alt="" width="463" height="204">

Now the objects that could not be visited in the process are considered unreachable and will be removed:

" alt="" width="463" height="204">

We can also imagine the process as spilling a huge bucket of paint from the roots, that flows through all references and marks all reachable objects. The unmarked ones are then removed.

That’s the concept of how garbage collection works. JavaScript engines apply many optimizations to make it run faster and not introduce any delays into the code execution.

Some of the optimizations:

-   <strong>Generational collection</strong> – objects are split into two sets: “new ones” and “old ones”. In typical code, many objects have a short life span: they appear, do their job and die fast, so it makes sense to track new objects and clear the memory from them if that’s the case. Those that survive for long enough, become “old” and are examined less often.
-   <strong>Incremental collection</strong> – if there are many objects, and we try to walk and mark the whole object set at once, it may take some time and introduce visible delays in the execution. So the engine splits the whole set of existing objects into multiple parts. And then clear these parts one after another. There are many small garbage collections instead of a total one. That requires some extra bookkeeping between them to track changes, but we get many tiny delays instead of a big one.
-   <strong>Idle-time collection</strong> – the garbage collector tries to run only while the CPU is idle, to reduce the possible effect on the execution.

There exist other optimizations and flavours of garbage collection algorithms. As much as I’d like to describe them here, I have to hold off, because different engines implement different tweaks and techniques. And, what’s even more important, things change as engines develop, so studying deeper “in advance”, without a real need is probably not worth that. Unless, of course, it is a matter of pure interest, then there will be some links for you below.
