# **Object methods, "this"** ([link resource](https://javascript.info/object-methods))

## **Method examples**

```javascript
let user = {
	name: "John",
	age: 30,
};

user.sayHi = function () {
	alert("Hello!");
};

user.sayHi(); // Hello!
```

We could use a pre-declared function as a method, like this:

```javascript
let user = {
	// ...
};

// first, declare
function sayHi() {
	alert("Hello!");
}

// then add as a method
user.sayHi = sayHi;

user.sayHi(); // Hello!
```

> [!NOTE]

> <strong>Object-oriented programming</strong>
> When we write our code using objects to represent entities, that’s called object-oriented programming, in short: “OOP”.

## **Method shorthand**

There exists a shorter syntax for methods in an object literal:

```javascript
// these objects do the same

user = {
	sayHi: function () {
		alert("Hello");
	},
};

// method shorthand looks better, right?
user = {
	sayHi() {
		// same as "sayHi: function(){...}"
		alert("Hello");
	},
};
```

As demonstrated, we can omit <code>"function"</code> and just write <code>sayHi()</code>.

## **"this" in methods**

It’s common that an object method needs to access the information stored in the object to do its job.

<strong>To access the object, a method can use the <code>this</code> keyword.</strong>

The value of <code>this</code> is the object “before dot”, the one used to call the method.

```javascript
let user = {
	name: "John",
	age: 30,

	sayHi() {
		// "this" is the "current object"
		alert(this.name);
	},
};

user.sayHi(); // John
```

Here during the execution of <code>user.sayHi()</code>, the value of <code>this</code> will be <code>user</code>.

Technically, it’s also possible to access the object without <code>this</code>, by referencing it via the outer variable:

```javascript
let user = {
	name: "John",
	age: 30,

	sayHi() {
		alert(user.name); // "user" instead of "this"
	},
};
```

…But such code is unreliable. If we decide to copy <code>user</code> to another variable, e.g. <code>admin = user</code> and overwrite <code>user</code> with something else, then it will access the wrong object.

That’s demonstrated below:

```javascript
let user = {
	name: "John",
	age: 30,

	sayHi() {
		alert(user.name); // leads to an error
	},
};

let admin = user;
user = null; // overwrite to make things obvious

admin.sayHi(); // TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of null
```

If we used <code>this.name</code> instead of <code>user.name</code> inside the <code>alert</code>, then the code would work.

## **"this" is not bound**

In JavaScript, keyword <code>this</code> behaves unlike most other programming languages. It can be used in any function, even if it’s not a method of an object.

```javascript
function sayHi() {
	alert(this.name);
}
```

The value of <code>this</code> is evaluated during the run-time, depending on the context.

```javascript
let user = {name: "John"};
let admin = {name: "Admin"};

function sayHi() {
	alert(this.name);
}

// use the same function in two objects
user.f = sayHi;
admin.f = sayHi;

// these calls have different this
// "this" inside the function is the object "before the dot"
user.f(); // John  (this == user)
admin.f(); // Admin  (this == admin)

admin["f"](); // Admin (dot or square brackets access the method – doesn't matter)
```

> <strong>Calling without an object: <code>this == undefined</code></strong>
> We can even call the function without an object at all:
>
> ```javascript
> function sayHi() {
> 	alert(this);
> }
> sayHi(); // undefined
> ```
>
> In this case <code>this</code> is <code>undefined</code> in strict mode. If we try to access <code>this.name</code>, there will be an error.
> In non-strict mode the value of <code>this</code> in such case will be the _global object_ (<code>window</code> in a browser, we’ll get to it later in the chapter Global object). This is a historical behavior that <code>"use strict"</code> fixes.
> Usually such call is a programming error. If there’s <code>this</code> inside a function, it expects to be called in an object context.

> [!NOTE]
>
> <strong>The consequences of unbound <code>this</code></strong>
> If you come from another programming language, then you are probably used to the idea of a “bound <code>this</code>”, where methods defined in an object always have <code>this</code> referencing that object.
>
> In JavaScript <code>this</code> is “free”, its value is evaluated at call-time and does not depend on where the method was declared, but rather on what object is “before the dot”.
>
> The concept of run-time evaluated <code>this</code> has both pluses and minuses. On the one hand, a function can be reused for different objects. On the other hand, the greater flexibility creates more possibilities for mistakes.
>
> Here our position is not to judge whether this language design decision is good or bad. We’ll understand how to work with it, how to get benefits and avoid problems.

## **Arrow functions have no "this"**

Arrow functions are special: they don’t have their “own” <code>this</code>. If we reference <code>this</code> from such a function, it’s taken from the outer “normal” function.

```javascript
let user = {
	firstName: "Ilya",
	sayHi() {
		let arrow = () => alert(this.firstName);
		arrow();
	},
};

user.sayHi(); // Ilya
```
