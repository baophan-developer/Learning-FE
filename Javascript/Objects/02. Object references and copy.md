# **Object references and copy** ([link resource](https://javascript.info/object-copy))

<strong>One of the fundamental differences of objects versus primitives is that objects are stored and copied “by reference”, whereas primitive values: strings, numbers, booleans, etc – are always copied “as a whole value”.</strong>

<strong>A variable assigned to an object stores not the object itself, but its “address in memory” – in other words “a reference” to it.</strong>

<strong>When an object variable is copied, the reference is copied, but the object itself is not duplicated.</strong>

```javascript
let user = {name: "John"};
let admin = user;
// Now we have two variables, each storing a reference to the same object.
```

## **Comparison by reference**

Two objects are equal only if they are the same object.

```javascript
let a = {};
let b = a; // copy the reference

alert(a == b); // true, both variables reference the same object
alert(a === b); // true
```

And here two independent objects are not equal, even though they look alike (both are empty).

```javascript
let a = {};
let b = {}; // two independent objects

alert(a == b); // false
```

## **Cloning and merging, Object.assign**

So, copying an object variable creates one more reference to the same object.

But what if we need to duplicate an object?

We can create a new object and replicate the structure of the existing one, by iterating over its properties and copying them on the primitive level.

```javascript
let user = {
	name: "John",
	age: 30,
};

let clone = {}; // the new empty object

// let's copy all user properties into it
for (let key in user) {
	clone[key] = user[key];
}

// now clone is a fully independent object with the same content
clone.name = "Pete"; // changed the data in it

alert(user.name); // still John in the original object
```

We can also use the method Object.assign.

The syntax is:

```javascript
Object.assign(dest, ...sources);
```

-   The first argument <code>dest</code> is a object target.
-   Further arguments is a list of source objects.

```javascript
let user = {name: "John"};

let permissions1 = {canView: true};
let permissions2 = {canEdit: true};

// copies all properties from permissions1 and permissions2 into user
Object.assign(user, permissions1, permissions2);

// now user = { name: "John", canView: true, canEdit: true }
alert(user.name); // John
alert(user.canView); // true
alert(user.canEdit); // true
```

If the copied property name already exists, it gets overwritten:

```javascript
let user = {name: "John"};

Object.assign(user, {name: "Pete"});

alert(user.name); // now user = { name: "Pete" }
```

We also can use <code>Object.assign</code> to perform a simple object cloning:

```javascript
let user = {
	name: "John",
	age: 30,
};

let clone = Object.assign({}, user);

alert(clone.name); // John
alert(clone.age); // 30
```

Here it copies all properties of <code>user</code> into the empty object and returns it.

## **Nested cloning**

Until now we assumed that all properties of <code>user</code> are primitive. But properties can be references to other objects.

```javascript
let user = {
	name: "John",
	sizes: {
		height: 182,
		width: 50,
	},
};

alert(user.sizes.height); // 182
```

Now it’s not enough to copy <code>clone.sizes = user.sizes</code>, because <code>user.sizes</code> is an object, and will be copied by reference, so <code>clone</code> and <code>user</code> will share the same sizes:

```javascript
let user = {
	name: "John",
	sizes: {
		height: 182,
		width: 50,
	},
};

let clone = Object.assign({}, user);

alert(user.sizes === clone.sizes); // true, same object

// user and clone share sizes
user.sizes.width = 60; // change a property from one place
alert(clone.sizes.width); // 60, get the result from the other one
```

### **structuredClone**

The call <code>structuredClone(object)</code> clones the <code>object</code> with all nested properties.

```javascript
let user = {
	name: "John",
	sizes: {
		height: 182,
		width: 50,
	},
};

let clone = structuredClone(user);

alert(user.sizes === clone.sizes); // false, different objects

// user and clone are totally unrelated now
user.sizes.width = 60; // change a property from one place
alert(clone.sizes.width); // 50, not related
```

Although, there are cases when structuredClone fails.

```javascript
// error
structuredClone({
	f: function () {},
});
```

Function properties aren’t supported.
