# **Comment Code** ([link resource](https://javascript.info/comments))

## **Bad comments**

Novices tend to use comments to explain “what is going on in the code”. Like this:

```javascript
// This code will do this thing (...) and that thing (...)
// ...and who knows what else...
very;
complex;
code;
```

But in good code, the amount of such “explanatory” comments should be minimal. Seriously, the code should be easy to understand without them.

## **Recipe: factor out functions**

Sometimes it’s beneficial to replace a code piece with a function, like here:

```javascript
function showPrimes(n) {
	nextPrime: for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
		// check if i is a prime number
		for (let j = 2; j < i; j++) {
			if (i % j == 0) continue nextPrime;
		}

		alert(i);
	}
}
```

The better variant, with a factored out function <code>isPrime</code>:

```javascript
function showPrimes(n) {
	for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
		if (!isPrime(i)) continue;

		alert(i);
	}
}

function isPrime(n) {
	for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
		if (n % i == 0) return false;
	}

	return true;
}
```

## **Recipe: create functions**

And if we have a long “code sheet” like this:

```javascript
// here we add whiskey
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	let drop = getWhiskey();
	smell(drop);
	add(drop, glass);
}

// here we add juice
for (let t = 0; t < 3; t++) {
	let tomato = getTomato();
	examine(tomato);
	let juice = press(tomato);
	add(juice, glass);
}

// ...
```

Then it might be a better variant to refactor it into functions like:

```javascript
addWhiskey(glass);
addJuice(glass);

function addWhiskey(container) {
	for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
		let drop = getWhiskey();
		//...
	}
}

function addJuice(container) {
	for (let t = 0; t < 3; t++) {
		let tomato = getTomato();
		//...
	}
}
```

## **Good comments**

<strong>Describe the architecture</strong>

Provide a high-level overview of components, how they interact, what’s the control flow in various situations… In short – the bird’s eye view of the code.

<strong>Document function parameters and usage</strong>

There’s a special syntax [JSDoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSDoc) to document a function: usage, parameters, returned value.

```javascript
/**
 * Returns x raised to the n-th power.
 *
 * @param {number} x The number to raise.
 * @param {number} n The power, must be a natural number.
 * @return {number} x raised to the n-th power.
 */
function pow(x, n) {
  ...
}
```

<strong>Why is the task solved this way?</strong>

Without such comments the following situation is possible:

1. You (or your colleague) open the code written some time ago, and see that it’s “suboptimal”.
2. You think: “How stupid I was then, and how much smarter I’m now”, and rewrite using the “more obvious and correct” variant.
3. …The urge to rewrite was good. But in the process you see that the “more obvious” solution is actually lacking. You even dimly remember why, because you already tried it long ago. You revert to the correct variant, but the time was wasted.

Comments that explain the solution are very important. They help to continue development the right way.

<strong>Any subtle features of the code? Where they are used?</strong>
